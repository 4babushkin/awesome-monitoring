## Bug Tracking
- [Sentry](https://getsentry.com/) - Application monitoring, event logging and aggregation.
- [Bugzilla](https://www.bugzilla.org/) - Bugzilla is a "Defect Tracking System" or "Bug-Tracking System". Defect Tracking Systems allow individual or groups of developers to keep track of outstanding bugs in their product effectively. Most commercial defect-tracking software vendors charge enormous licensing fees. Despite being "free", Bugzilla has many features its expensive counterparts lack. Consequently, Bugzilla has quickly become a favorite of thousands of organizations across the globe.
- [Mantis](https://www.mantisbt.org/) - MantisBT is an open source issue tracker that provides a delicate balance between simplicity and power. Users are able to get started in minutes and start managing their projects while collaborating with their teammates and clients effectively. Once you start using it, you will never go back!
- [Trac](https://trac.edgewall.org/) - Trac is an enhanced wiki and issue tracking system for software development projects. Trac uses a minimalistic approach to web-based software project management. Our mission is to help developers write great software while staying out of the way. Trac should impose as little as possible on a team's established development process and policies.
- [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org/) - Redmine is a flexible project management web application. Written using the Ruby on Rails framework, it is cross-platform and cross-database.
Redmine is open source and released under the terms of the GNU General Public License v2 (GPL).

On the server side, RT requires a Unix-like or Linux operating system, SQL database, web server, and Perl.
- [OTRS](https://www.otrs.com/) - OTRS bug tracking software is written in Perl. OTRS has all standard defect tracking features that you would expect. View full list of features [here](https://www.otrs.com/feature-overview-of-our-help-desk-solution/).

- [Fossil](http://www.fossil-scm.org/) - Fossil is written in C, and uses SQLite database. Apart from bug tracking, it also provides Wiki. Installation is very straight forward, as it is a single executable that contains everything you need to get fossil up and running.
- [The Bug Genie](http://www.thebuggenie.com/) - Bug genie is written in PHP. Provides a wizard based bug tracking software. It also integrates the openSearch functionality. Integrates with Subversion. You can develop your custom modules on top of bug genie.
- [WebIssues](http://webissues.mimec.org/) - WebIssue is written in PHP, and uses MySQL database for the server side. Everything in this top 10 list is web based bug tracking system except WebIssues. This is at number#10 because it doesnâ€™t provide a web-based interface. You need webissues client that runs on Windows, or Linux to access the server component.
